                <p>A lot of school still have a heavy focus on Python, Ruby, and iOS development, but at Devschool, we are firmly planted in two camps. We primarily use JavaScript to teach programming, and we are huge fans of functional programming, to the point we teach you functional programming from day one.</p>
<!--more-->
<h2 id="the-future-belongs-to-javascript">The future belongs to JavaScript</h2>
<p>There is only one language that runs in every browser on the plant. JavaScript. Therefore, for us, it is not a question of what to teach, but how to teach it. As of July 2016 we have switched from teaching JavaScript in it&#39;s current form to es6, the next form of JavaScript!</p>
<p>While we were huge fans of classless, prototypical, modularized JavaScript without &#39;proper block scoping&#39; es6 has so many features that make our daily programming lives more enjoyable, we have put down the old curmudgeon in us and switched tools.</p>
<p>You can transpile the JavaScript of Tomorrow (today by now) into code that runs in your browser today and take advantage of so many more ways of building solid, beautiful JavaScript applications!</p>
<h2 id="teaching-stale-technologies-is-not-what-we-are-about">Teaching stale technologies is NOT what we are about</h2>
<p>We still show you traditional JavaScript, but only after you have learned to live in a post-semicon world. This will reduce the amount of outdated information you have banging around in your skull. It will also help reduce bad habits that are so prevalent in pre es6 JavaScript.</p>
<p>While other schools are stuck &#39;teaching the curriculum&#39;, we are free to advance the bar and jump higher and further! Our students get to learn the new hotness NOW, and they get to show employers they can code es6 code LIVE in front of the interviewer.</p>
<h2 id="our-school-used-to-teach-a-lot-more-ruby-on-rails-than-we-do-today">Our school used to teach a lot more Ruby on Rails than we do today</h2>
<p>We still LOVE Ruby, but the fact is, the world has moved on and Ruby couldn&#39;t keep up. Just because we personally love programming in a particular language doesn&#39;t mean it is the commercially viable and correct option. We have chosen to put our students&#39; interests first and formally make the switch mid 2015 to JavaScript, and as of July 2016, we moved the focus ahead again to es6!</p>
<p>In the future when the bar starts to move again and we see something else take over in the market, you can assure we will &#39;React&#39; (pun intended) quickly and make the switch for the sake of our students and our school! Ps... React is probably the coolest fucking thing since AJAX was invented. Like ice cream on a hot day cool. Bad ass. We focus on React for front end development these days to match the advancements in JavaScript. (React is built in es6)</p>
<h2 id="we-still-teach-ruby-on-rails-and-haskell">We still teach Ruby on Rails and Haskell</h2>
<p>There are times when you want a &#39;quick n dirty&#39; backend. Something you can prototype FAST and then hook up a React-based front-end to. When this is the situation that confronts you, we still offer an incredible amount of experience in this arena. Besides, the JavaScript we teach you to write is very similar to the Ruby we teach, which is also very much like the Haskell we teach advanced students.</p>
<p>Functional Programming and JavaScript baby. We dig it, do you?</p>

I did a lot of research before deciding on Devschool. From a pragmatic standpoint, I&#39;m receiving hundreds of hours of personalized education, a personalized education plan, and constant support for a very fair price.

I took a coding bootcamp in Columbia first, but I missed a lot of key topics and was left with almost more questions than answers. My Devschool instructor filled those gaps, and took the time to answer my questions and now I have my dream job!

After months of searching I started reading about Devschool and how highly the school was recommended was from previous students who graduated the program.  I spoke with Jim numerous times and he was always patient when it came to answering my questions and concerns.

I attended Dev Bootcamp in NYC. I found that even after 10 hours a day at school learning and hacking, I was missing some major areas in programming. Devschool quickly filled those gaps and I got my job!

I would highly Devschool for any prospective students out there! I was a student for about 4 months and learned a ton. I now have that developer job I wanted because of what I learned at Devschool!

The reason I chose the Devschool is that it is not really a bootcamp as we usually understand the word - it is a mentorship mixed with a friendship and strong community. Exactly what I needed: build a real world projects of my choice using tools I want or which are really in trend today.
