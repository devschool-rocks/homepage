Instead I was referring far more to the way students are shuffled through the system with little personal attention and even less deviation from the school&#39;s recipe.</p><a href="2016/04/11/the-devschool-difference-humans-first.html">Continue reading this article</a></div></div></div></div></div><footer id="footer" class="dark"><div class="container"><div class="footer-widgets-wrap clearfix"><div class="col_one_third"><div class="widget clearfix"><div style="background: url('/images/world-map.png') no-repeat center center; background-size: 100%"><address><strong>Corporate:</strong><br>8 THE GREEN Suite #4595<br>Dover Delaware 19901<br></address><abbr title="Phone Number"><strong>Phone:</strong></abbr> (01) 702 7999907<br><abbr title="Email Address"><strong>Email:</strong></abbr> hello@devschool.rocks<br></div></div></div><div class="col_one_third"><div class="widget clearfix"><h4>Student Testimonials</h4><div class="fslider testimonial no-image nobg noborder noshadow nopadding" data-animation="slide" data-arrows="false"><div class="flexslider"><div class="slider-wrap"><div class="slide"><div class="testi-content"><p>I did a lot of research before deciding on Devschool.
