title: Why we asked to be removed from CourseReport

I am taking a moment from duties I enjoy a shit load more, namely teaching students how to build a website chat feature using es6, React and Websockets!

However, after having my name dragged through the mud by a certain a certain failed student and after being ignored by CourseReport when I tried to have it dealt with, I feel the need to say something about the matter.

### It only takes one bad apple....

Be very careful of who you accept into your school! A single bad student can ruin the experience for everyone else, which is one reason why we have been so serious about the "no asshole rule" when we screen candidates. Unfortunately I missed an asshole because she was a woman and I was more focused on giving an education to a woman from a developing country than trying to determine if she would be a good student for us.

This student did a SINGLE session with us, and then proceeded to contact every student we had on Slack and start spreading misinformation and trying to bring school morale. She gathered up everyone's email addresses and then threatened to email them all to her 'attorney'.

She demanded we write her a 4 month long custom curriculum or she was going to quit the school. I explained to her that we don't write out that sort of thing for any student as it goes completely against our organic education policy. I told her if she wanted a canned curriculum that everyone else does, she was in the wrong school.

### 100% Organic means 100% Organic

At Devschool we only do the organic. Students come up against problems naturally, and then solve them, also naturally. This just means that depending on what you decide to build and when, you will encounter different programming problems and techniques in an organic manner.

There is no reason for us to make you trudge through a month of HTML and CSS if you really aren't into such things. Many programmers spend their entire careers without writing a line of HTML. We also don't force you down JavaScript or Ruby or Haskell. That depends on the project you want to build!

Myabe you want to focus only on JavaScript, maybe you only care about mastering React and es6. Or perhaps you really enjoy HTML and CSS and graphic design, in which case we will hook you up with a custom curriculum that matches your goals. Will it be written out and posted online? No. It is your curriculum, not someone else's so what is the point in standardizing it? We aren't McDonalds!

### Course Report, a place to pay for false authority

When our school first started a couple of years ago, we worked very hard to court CourseReport into getting us some coverage. We had several long conversations with their head of community about how we could improve our visibility with their website.

After months of wasted time, it was clear that CourseReport is a 'pay for play' scheme pretending to be a source of Coding Bootcamp information. Even after we agreed to fork over the money needed to get us 'top placement' we were told it wasn't enough and the 'big' schools had essentially booked all the spots for the next year.

We kept trying them back and we kept getting the same answer. "You aren't big enough for us to give a shit and you don't have 10k to drop on us for advertising" (paraphrased). We essentially wrote them off at that point after paying thousands for an article on our school.

Then something quote interesting happened. Something that says a LOT about their company and the people who run the community side of the business.

## Fake reviews and a cold response

We got a bad review that was full of lies and gargabe that never happened. The reviewer never attended our school. They never enrolled, they never paid us a dime. And yet here they are on CourseReport shredding us because we are too 'Liberal' and because I (Jim OKelly) smokes pot.

Since the 'student' never attended our school in any manner, we asked for the fake review to be taken down. We were told bluntly that CourseReport will not remove reviews or even look into whether they are real or not. Allowing people to negatively review a product they have never purchased is rather silly.

We again wrote them off again as we are quite busy teaching students to code. I figured I would just ignore their site from then on as they were sending us maybe 50 people a month and the visits they sent were of terrible quality. In fact, out of the three refunds we have made in the last 3 months, they were ALL CourseReport referals.

So we are ending our 'relationship' with CourseReport. Propping up fake reviews while accepting 10s of thousands for pay to play placement while pretending to be a review/news site is disgusting. Do a search for Devbootcamp or Thinkful and look at the negative reviews, then do a look through CourseReport. You will find schools with horrible practices look great on CourseReport while they are being picked apart publically for their shady practices.

## Some thoughts from our students


## Moving forward like we have always done

We didn't start this school this school to get rich. We started this school because there was so much shitty code in the world, written by terrible programmers with horrible habits. That was the problem we wanted to tackle. I think that might be the main difference between Devschool and the thousands of Big Box Bootcamps out there.

While other schools turn out 30-50 'developers' every 12 weeks, we turn out 10 every 6 months or so. We demand that students learn functional programming over imperative programming, and they learn good programming habits. We teach them to use master-level tools like the command-line, ssh, and vim.

Students stay in our program much longer than other places for two reasons: 1) we don't want to ship bad products or graduate terrible programmers and 2) you spend more time in our program as you can be self-paced. You aren't dragged along for the sake of someone else's schedule.

So we will continue to train top notch developers and we will continue to do so on our own terms, by our own rules. I don't care how many fake reviews liars and their enablers put up. I have 5 years of REAL reviews telling the world that not only do I know my shit inside and out, but I care enough about students to prepare them for a real career in software development.

Fuck the haters.

### final note

You will notice I did not name any names here. I only spoke to circumstances and situations and I only outed CourseReport as a company for their terrible practices. I didn't name the terrible, lying, dim student (she knows who she is) because unlike her, I don't believe in public slander. This post was just a brief cathartic departure from my normal teaching duties to put a few facts out there. I will now go back to the 20 students who love Devschool... I have to teach them how to build a website chat feature using WebSockets and React!
