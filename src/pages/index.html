	<p class="lead"><strong>How can we boast such a thing?</strong> Well, it is actually VERY SIMPLE (hint,
	we like simple). You don't graduate until you get a job, therefore 100%
	of our graduates have jobs!</p>

	<h3>But what if I find it hard to find work? What if I don't get a job?</h3>

	<p class="lead">Without any further cost to you, we will continue to fight on your side,
	working every day to help get you a job until we get you placed. But to be
	honest, finding people jobs has not been our problem. It has been keeping
	people enrolled in the program their last few weeks because they keep getting
	hired before they finish their studies with us!</p>

	<p class="lead">After you complete the "dev school" program you will continue to have access to chat
	and the group sessions and even interview assistance! We are in this for the
	long haul, building relationships with our alumni that will hopefully last
	lifetimes!</p>

	  <p class="lead">You see, at Devschool, we start with the Student experience and work forward from there to our goals that involve creating a sustainable, profitable, socially conscionable developer school.</p>

	  <p class="lead">It is an article of faith here that if we listen to our customers' needs, make them feel special, guide them towards a prosperous career, and help them land that first job with confidence, then profits and margins and all that 'businessy' stuff will just take care of itself.</p>

	  <p class="lead">Maybe we are naive, but we don't think so. Instead, and so far the data is showing, that a programming school can be founded and run without the top-heavy management of MBAs. Our genuine desire to build life-long, positive relationships with our Students, is worth far more than any penny we could ever squeeze.</p>

	  <p class="lead">Honestly we don't care if we are called crazy. We are proud to be among those who think and do different.</p>

	<h2>What does the Devschool brand stand for?</h2>
      </div>

      <p class="lead">To put it simply, Devschool stands for the highest standard of excellence in customer service and student education. It is a very hard mark to hit and it keeps us on our toes, but so far we have a 100% approval rating from our alumni, and much of that is due to our relentless duty to our Students' happieness.</p>

      <p>For instance, every Instructor we hire must exibit not only a strong desire to teach the next generation of programmers in a fun and energetic, informative manner, but they also must promise to hold the torch of our Student experience high and represent the brand at all times.</p>

      <p>You see, at Devschool the Student is always right when it comes to their perception of service. "They pay, they say" is our motto and it extends to how our Students are treated, respected, and ultimately prepared for their careers in coding.</p>

      <p>After our Students, our Brand is our most important asset, and we understand how our brand is ultimately labeled, not by us, but by the world around us. We feel that by jealously guarding the experience and education of our students and always helping someone when we can, we will deliver such amazing experience our brand awareness will spread on it own.</p>

	<h2>Our job placement numbers explained</h2>
      </div>

      <p class="lead">We have a 100 % hire rate after graduation, but unlike some of the Big Box Bootcamps, our numbers are easy to explain!</p>

      <p>When you complete your interning hours and are nearing the end of your 42 private sessions, you begin looking for work. During you job search we advise you on how to make yourself more palatable by employers and help you complete AND UNDERSTAND the code challenges you will be given as part of that job search.</p>

      <p>When you get your first job you graduate the program. If you don't get the job you do what winners do, you keep looking, and in the meanwhile we try to find a place for you with one of our non profit partners.</p>

	<h2>What our job guarantee means</h2>

      <p class="lead">We don't stop working for you until you get a job. You pay no additional cost for this service, it is part of why Devschool is radically different from the so called competition. They give you McDonalds we give you steak.</p>
