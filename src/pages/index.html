      people enrolled in the program their last few weeks because they keep getting
      hired before they finish their studies with us!</p>

      <p class="lead">After you complete our full stack developer bootcamp program you will 
      continue to have access to chat and the group sessions and even interview assistance!

        <p class="lead">Maybe we are naive, but we don't think so. Instead, and so far the data is showing, that a programming school can be founded and run without the top-heavy management of MBAs.

      <h2>What does the Devschool brand stand for?</h2>
    </div>

    <p class="lead">To put it simply, Devschool stands for the highest standard of excellence in customer service and student education. It is a very hard mark to hit and it keeps us on our toes, but so far we have a 100% approval rating from our alumni, and much of that is due to our relentless duty to our Students' happiness.</p>

    <p>For instance, every Instructor we hire must exhibit not only a strong desire to teach the next generation of programmers in a fun and energetic, informative manner, but they also must promise to hold the torch of our Student experience high and represent the brand at all times.</p>

    <p>You see, at Devschool the Student is always right when it comes to their perception of service. "They pay, they say" is our motto and it extends to how our Students are treated, respected, and ultimately prepared for their careers in coding.</p>

    <p>After our Students, our Brand is our most important asset, and we understand how our brand is ultimately labeled, not by us, but by the world around us. We feel that by jealously guarding the experience and education of our students and always helping someone when we can, we will deliver such amazing experience our brand awareness will spread on it own.</p>
