What if I don't find a job?</h3><p class="lead">Without any further cost to you, we continue to fight on your side, working every day to help get you a job until we get you placed.

Instead, and so far the data is showing, that a programming school can be founded and run without the top-heavy management of MBAs. Our genuine desire to build life-long, positive relationships with our Students, is worth far more than any penny we could ever squeeze.</p><p class="lead">Honestly we don't care if we are called crazy.

It is a very hard mark to hit and it keeps us on our toes, but so far we have a 100% approval rating from our alumni, and much of that is due to our relentless duty to our Students' happiness.</p><p>For instance, every Instructor we hire must exhibit not only a strong desire to teach the next generation of programmers in a fun and energetic, informative manner, but they also must promise to hold the torch of our Student experience high and represent the brand at all times.</p><p>You see, at Devschool the Student is always right when it comes to their perception of service. "They pay, they say" is our motto and it extends to how our Students are treated, respected, and ultimately prepared for their careers in coding.</p><p>After our Students, our Brand is our most important asset, and we understand how our brand is ultimately labeled, not by us, but by the world around us. We feel that by jealously guarding the experience and education of our students and always helping someone when we can, we deliver such amazing experience our brand awareness will spread on it own.</p></div></section></div><section id="faq"><div class="content-wrap"><div class="container topmargin clearfix"><div class="heading-block nobottomborder"><h2>The Devschool FAQ</h2></div><p>Over the last couple of years we have been compiling questions prospective students just like yourself have asked us.

Live in NYC? Why not get a high paying job there. Live in Akron Ohio? Maybe remote work would suit you better. What if you want to start your own consulting service? You can do that to. At around session 40 (out of 50) we start you on the job search. You do the leg-work, we provide the inside knowledge on how to nail the job!</div><div class="acctitle">What happens if I donâ€™t have a job when I finish the program?</div><div class="acc_content clearfix" style="display: none">At Devschool, you graduate when you get a job as a coder. That means when you run out of sessions (something that so far hasn&#39;t happened) before you get a job, we stick with you. You stay in the school, you still get access to all the sessions and the chat and the support network.</div><div class="acctitle">What salaries do your students end up taking?</div><div class="acc_content clearfix" style="display: none">It all depends on where you live, and where you want to work. Want to be a digital nomad and travel the world while coding for a living? Well, working remote gets you paid less, but you get to travel the world. Do you live in NYC or Silicon Valley? Well, you will make a lot more, but it also costs a lot more. In general we don&#39;t collect salary information and it is the wrong metric to focus on anyway. We advise you to take whatever job fits your lifestyle at first. Then put in some dues like you are expected to. Make a good impression and some good business connections, then start looking for more money and a better job. You need your foot in the door first!</div></div></div><div class="col-md-6 marginbottom"><h4 class="topmargin">Onboarding <small>(3)</small></h4><div class="accordion accordion-border clearfix" data-state="closed"><div class="acctitle">How often do you enroll new classes, how soon can I start?</div><div class="acc_content clearfix" style="display: none">We onboard every Monday when we have seats available and students to fill those virtual seats. We will never overbook our Instructors (who the fuck wants to work too hard anyway?) and therefore you will get the attention you need. Onboard Monday, start Tuesday. If you need to start the following Friday because you are in Venice... hell yeah! Not a problem.</div><div class="acctitle">Can I pay now and enroll to save my seat and start at a later date?</div><div class="acc_content clearfix" style="display: none">Yeah, we have the ability to do that as well.

The most important aspect will be the amount of RAM, 4 gigs is OK, 8 is much better</div></div></div><div class="col-md-6 marginbottom"><h4 class="topmargin">Application Process <small>(3)</small></h4><div class="accordion accordion-border clearfix" data-state="closed"><div class="acctitle">Do you take beginners at Devschool or do I need to prep?</div><div class="acc_content clearfix" style="display: none">We have no problem being your first serious introduction to programming, so we aren&#39;t going to ask you to go jump through some more hoops while you wait to join.</div><div class="acctitle">Do you accept everyone?</div><div class="acc_content clearfix" style="display: none">We accept non-assholes, who can read, who will work hard, and who want something in life.</div><div class="acctitle">Do you offer any scholarships or grants?</div><div class="acc_content clearfix" style="display: none">Yep. We have a couple of grants available. You can get $500 off for &quot;Underrepresented in tech&quot;, or 30% off for being from a developing country (Mexico, Brazil, Philippines, etc.)</div></div></div><div class="col-md-6 marginbottom"><h4 class="topmargin">Grants/Scholarships <small>(3)</small></h4><div class="accordion accordion-border clearfix" data-state="closed"><div class="acctitle">Do you have something for Women or Minorities in technology?</div><div class="acc_content clearfix" style="display: none">$500 to you if you are missing a Y or you don&#39;t match the common profile of the programmer. In some cases we will allow you to double up on this and the Vet discount!</div><div class="acctitle">Do you offer grants for Military Veterans/Peace Corps?</div><div class="acc_content clearfix" style="display: none">Absolutely!

It can teach you a lot of really cool things about programming. Ruby on Rails makes building websites backed by a relational database fast and easy. However, JavaScript is the future and we will see a slow dying out of Ruby over the next 10 years. Do you want to build apps as an entrepreneur? Then you should do Ruby on Rails and build your application guided by our expert instructors. Do you want to get a job as a programmer building web applications of the future? Well, JavaScript and Node is a much better choice with some Ruby sprinkled in as an elective.</div><div class="acctitle">Do I get a detailed curriculum?</div><div class="acc_content clearfix" style="display: none">There is no detailed curriculum or anything you can read up on in advanced - it is 100% shaped by your personal goals and interests. Our program is based on experience and a real work environment, not school, which makes the idea of a canned list up front much less appealing.</div><div class="acctitle">Do you teach any Angular, React, Meteor, or Ruby Rails?</div><div class="acc_content clearfix" style="display: none">Yes, although we focus on the language and style of programming, data structures, and principles like SOLID more than specific frameworks. If you are taking JavaScript you will learn react, webpack, browserify, gulp, express, and node from us, and then supplement your framework diet with expert instruction from the included license to FrontEndMasters.com. If you are studying Ruby or a mix of the two you will learn Ruby on Rails.</div><div class="acctitle">What if I want to take both courses?</div><div class="acc_content clearfix" style="display: none">You can mix the two courses for the same price, however you still get 50 personal sessions total. You can also pay for both courses and get 100 personal sessions.</div></div></div><div class="col-md-6 marginbottom"><h4 class="topmargin">Our Pricing <small>(5)</small></h4><div class="accordion accordion-border clearfix" data-state="closed"><div class="acctitle">Do you have a way to split the enrollment cost up?</div><div class="acc_content clearfix" style="display: none">Absolutely! We have a layaway plan, which is 50% down and 50% to start. The first half puts you on our special list of incoming students and you get first pick on the next available seats as soon as you pay the second half of your enrollment. But even before then, you get access to our #slack channel so you can socialize with your fellow Devschoolers and to participate in live group sessions led by programming experts!</div><div class="acctitle">Do you offer financing or payments?</div><div class="acc_content clearfix" style="display: none">We are now offering in-house financing to select students as part of a private beta program. Rates range from 5-15% APR and for 2-5 years with no prepayment penalty. We will be able to offer an expanded, public beta of our financing program January 2017.</div><div class="acctitle">What forms of payment are accepted?</div><div class="acc_content clearfix" style="display: none">We use Stripe and Stripeâ€™s card processing service supports US-issued card and most non-US issued cards with a Visa, MasterCard, Discover, JCB, or American Express, including credit, debit, pre-paid, or gift cards. We also accept bank transfers from the USA and Mexico.</div><div class="acctitle">Do you offer any grants or scholarships?</div><div class="acc_content clearfix" style="display: none">Yep. Check out the Grants/Scholarship FAQ section..</div><div class="acctitle">How exactly does the financing program work?</div><div class="acc_content clearfix" style="display: none">We can offer rates are from 6-20%* annually with 2-3 year terms on up to 60% of your tuition. Should you drop out of the program, you will be required to pay the agreed interest schedule. Educational loans are offered by our partner, NerdLoans. * Your rate is determined via a credit-check and the availability of a non-spouse co-signer. Financing is only available on $4000 of the Web Developer course, and $10000 of the Software Engineering course; The initial $4000 must be paid to secure the loan and your seat at Devschool.</div></div></div><div class="col-md-6 marginbottom"><h4 class="topmargin">How it works <small>(5)</small></h4><div class="accordion accordion-border clearfix" data-state="closed"><div class="acctitle">Do I learn from live mentorship or watching videos?</div><div class="acc_content clearfix" style="display: none">What if I told you, you get to have your cake and eat it too? Well get those forks ready, because you learn from live experts, one on one, coding software together in real time. But you also have full access to egghead.io and frontendmasters.com when you enroll with us. To top it off, those live one on ones with real experts? Those are recorded locally on your machine, automagically, every-time, so you can build your own library of 50+ kick ass screencasts to mark your education milestones!</div><div class="acctitle">Does this program include pair programming?</div><div class="acc_content clearfix" style="display: none">Hell yes! Pair programming is actually quite a bit like the life-blood of our program. You start off by pairing directly with your Instructors, and when you don&#39;t know anything yet, they are typing, or telling you what to type. That graduates to you sharing the duties, and eventually when you are towards the end of the program, you pair with other advanced students.</div><div class="acctitle">How does the electives system work?</div><div class="acc_content clearfix" style="display: none">We don&#39;t just teach coding, we teach job skills, design skills, management skills, business skills, marketing skills, seo skills, you know. We help you get some skills. Lots of em. You can elect for any session along the way to discuss a large array of topics that will be listed in it&#39;s own section.</div><div class="acctitle">How long does it take to complete the program?</div><div class="acc_content clearfix" style="display: none">It will take 50 weeks to complete the program.</div><div class="acctitle">How often do I meet with my instructor?</div><div class="acc_content clearfix" style="display: none">After you have your onboarding session, you get your 1 personal session scheduled with your Instructors. Those appointments happen each week unless you need to miss or change one. It is fine to cancel last moment with us. We might be code therapists, but we aren&#39;t psychologists! You can just make up that appointment another time.</div></div></div></div></div></section><section id="apply" class="section nomargin noborder bgcolor dark" style="margin-bottom: 0px"><div class="content-wrap"><div class="container clearfix bottommargin"><div class="heading-block center nomargin"><h3>Make 2016 the year you change your life!</h3></div></div><div class="container clear-bottommargin clearfix"><div class="row form"><div class="form-card"><p>Learn to code online, at your own pace, at Devschool's online coding bootcamp!</p><p class="pricing-section-title center"><a data-animate="fadeInUp" data-delay="600" class="button button-3d joinNowBtn button-large nobottommargin fadeInUp animated">APPLY TODAY!</a></p></div></div></div></div></section><div class="dark modal" id="applyModal" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="applyModal" aria-hidden="true"><div class="modal-dialog"><div class="modal-content"><div class="modal-header"><button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">Ã—</button><p class="lead">We have a few seats left, so your time to grab one is now!</p></div><div class="modal-body"><p>In order to claim your Devschool Acceptance Interview, open a new browser tab, and do a google search for <strong>coding bootcamp</strong> and then find our link and take a screenshot of the google page you found us on.</p><p>Then shoot an email to <a href="mailto:applications@devschool.rocks">applications@devschool.rocks</a> and include <strong>I want to join Devschool and change my life</strong> in the subject, along with the position you found us at.</p><p>Include the screenshot you took as an attachment, and leave us some info on why you would take your education seriously and do the work it takes to be successful!
