      <h3>The <strong>Big Box Bootcamps</strong> want to <strong>take a lot of your money and</strong>
	then shove you through a predetermined course to maximize their own profits and so they can,
	<strong>hire sub-standard Instructors</strong>.</h3>

      <p class="lead">They seem to think this is a <strong>gold rush</strong>, and that you are the miners,
      coming far and wide, filled with dreams of making a living, and that it is their job to
      sell you shovels, wheelbarrows, donkeys and blasting powder for <strong>3x a fair amount</strong>.</p>

      <h3><strong>Meanwhile...</strong> Devschool was <strong>founded by developers and engineers</strong>,
	not MBAs who are just on a land-grab.</h3>

      <p class="lead">As new programmers, you are our new Brothers and Sisters
      and <strong>we are fiercely protective of our own</strong>, this is one of the many reasons why
      <strong>we are priced reasonably</strong> as well. Devschool is not just for the rich.</p>

	  <p class="lead">Maybe we are naive, but we don't think so. Instead, and so far the data is showing, that a programming school can be founded and run without the top-heavy management of MBAs. Our genuine desire to build life-long, positive relationships with our Students, is worth far more than any penny we could ever squeeze.</p>

	<h2>What does the Devschool brand stand for?</h2>
      </div>

      <p class="lead">To put it simply, Devschool stands for the highest standard of excellence in customer service and student education. It is a very hard mark to hit and it keeps us on our toes, but so far we have a 100% approval rating from our alumni, and much of that is due to our relentless duty to our Students' happieness.</p>

      <p>For instance, every Instructor we hire must exibit not only a strong desire to teach the next generation of programmers in a fun and energetic, informative manner, but they also must promise to hold the torch of our Student experience high and represent the brand at all times.</p>

      <p>You see, at Devschool the Student is always right when it comes to their perception of service. "They pay, they say" is our motto and it extends to how our Students are treated, respected, and ultimately prepared for their careers in coding.</p>

      <p>After our Students, our Brand is our most important asset, and we understand how our brand is ultimately labeled, not by us, but by the world around us. We feel that by jealously guarding the experience and education of our students and always helping someone when we can, we will deliver such amazing experience our brand awareness will spread on it own.</p>

      <p class="lead">We have a 100 % hire rate after graduation, but unlike some of the Big Box Bootcamps, our numbers are easy to explain!</p>

      <p>When you complete your interning hours and are nearing the end of your 42 private sessions, you begin looking for work. During you job search we advise you on how to make yourself more palatable by employers and help you complete AND UNDERSTAND the code challenges you will be given as part of that job search.</p>

      <p>When you get your first job you graduate the program. If you don't get the job you do what winners do, you keep looking, and in the meanwhile we try to find a place for you with one of our non profit partners.</p>

      <p class="lead">We don't stop working for you until you get a job. You pay no additional cost for this service, it is part of why Devschool is radically different from the so called competition. They give you McDonalds we give you steak.</p>

I would highly recommend Jim and Devschool for any prospective students out there! I have been a student for about 4 months and have learned a ton. Initially I wanted to find a program to help me transition from IT support to a developer and find a programmer job. I now have that developer job and I owe a big thanks to Devschool for helping me develop the required skills to get it.

The reason I chose the Devschool is that it is not a "bootcamp" as we usually understand the word - it is a mentorship mixed with a friendship and strong community. Exactly what I needed: build a real world projects of my choice using tools I want or which are really in trend today.

I took my first devbootcamp in my city, but in the middle of my bussy life (work - bootcamp) I missed a lot of key topics that leave behind a lot of questions without answers. Devschool filled all those gaps and much more!

I was one of Jim's first official Devschool students back in April of 2015 after having been his customer for several months previously while I attended Dev Bootcamp in NYC. I found that even after 10 hours a day at school learning and hacking, I was missing some major understanding in the Rails stack and in some of the smaller details of web development.

After months of searching I started reading about Devschool and how highly the school was recommended was from previous students who graduated the program.  I spoke with Jim numerous times and he was always patient when it came to answering my questions and concerns, and I was impressed with how Devschool was not the typical “Big Box” outfit.

I did a lot of research before deciding on Devschool. From a pragmatic standpoint, I'm receiving hundreds of hours of personalized education, a personalized education plan, and constant support for a very fair price. On a more personal level, I spoke to Jim for like 20 minutes and I quickly realized that I wanted to enroll.
