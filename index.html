You don't graduate until you get a job, therefore 100% of our graduates have jobs!</p><h3>But what if I find it hard to find work? What if I don't get a job?</h3><p class="lead">Without any further cost to you, we will continue to fight on your side, working every day to help get you a job until we get you placed. But to be honest, finding people jobs has not been our problem. It has been keeping people enrolled in the program their last few weeks because they keep getting hired before they finish their studies with us!</p><p class="lead">After you complete our full stack developer bootcamp program you will continue to have access to chat and the group sessions and even interview assistance! We are in this for the long haul, building relationships with our alumni that will hopefully last lifetimes!</p></div></div><div class="section blue"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="heading-block center nomargin"><h3>Yes, Devschool teaches you to code, but we go much further than that!

Instead, and so far the data is showing, that a programming school can be founded and run without the top-heavy management of MBAs. Our genuine desire to build life-long, positive relationships with our Students, is worth far more than any penny we could ever squeeze.</p><p class="lead">Honestly we don't care if we are called crazy.

It is a very hard mark to hit and it keeps us on our toes, but so far we have a 100% approval rating from our alumni, and much of that is due to our relentless duty to our Students' happiness.</p><p>For instance, every Instructor we hire must exibit not only a strong desire to teach the next generation of programmers in a fun and energetic, informative manner, but they also must promise to hold the torch of our Student experience high and represent the brand at all times.</p><p>You see, at Devschool the Student is always right when it comes to their perception of service. "They pay, they say" is our motto and it extends to how our Students are treated, respected, and ultimately prepared for their careers in coding.</p><p>After our Students, our Brand is our most important asset, and we understand how our brand is ultimately labeled, not by us, but by the world around us. We feel that by jealously guarding the experience and education of our students and always helping someone when we can, we will deliver such amazing experience our brand awareness will spread on it own.</p></div></div><div class="section parallax full-screen nomargin noborder" style="background: #eee url(/images/bg_white_crinkle-1c6b9c43bd.jpg)" data-stellar-background-ratio="0.4"><div class="container topmargin clearfix"><div class="heading-block nobottomborder"><h2>Our job placement numbers explained</h2></div><p class="lead">We have a 100 % hire rate after graduation, but unlike some of the Big Box Bootcamps, our numbers are easy to explain!</p><p>When you complete your interning hours and are nearing the end of your 42 private sessions, you begin looking for work. During you job search we advise you on how to make yourself more palatable by employers and help you complete AND UNDERSTAND the code challenges you will be given as part of that job search.</p><p>When you get your first job you graduate the program. If you don't get the job you do what winners do, you keep looking, and in the meanwhile we try to find a place for you with one of our non profit partners.</p><div class="heading-block nobottomborder"><h2>What our job guarantee means</h2></div><p class="lead">We don't stop working for you until you get a job.

This is our attempt at giving you all the answers you need to make the choice to join Devschool and change your life!</p><div class="col-md-6 marginbottom"><h4 class="topmargin">Job Placement <small>(3)</small></h4><div class="accordion accordion-border clearfix" data-state="closed"><div class="acctitle">What happens if I don’t have a job when I finish the program?</div><div class="acc_content clearfix" style="display: none">At Devschool, you graduate when you get a job as a coder. That means when you run out of sessions (something that so far hasn&#39;t happened) before you get a job, we stick with you. You stay in the school, you still get access to all the group sessions and the chat and the support network.</div><div class="acctitle">What kind of jobs can I get when I graduate?</div><div class="acc_content clearfix" style="display: none">That is really up to your needs. Live in NYC? Why not get a high paying job there. Live in Akron Ohio? Maybe remote work would suit you better. What if you want to start your own consulting service? You can do that to. At around session 40 (out of 50) we start you on the job search. You do the leg-work, we provide the inside knowledge on how to nail the job!</div><div class="acctitle">What salaries do your students end up taking?</div><div class="acc_content clearfix" style="display: none">It all depends on where you live, and where you want to work. Want to be a digital nomad and travel the world while coding for a living? Well, working remote gets you paid less, but you get to travel the world. Do you live in NYC or Silicon Valley? Well, you will make a lot more, but it also costs a lot more. In general we don&#39;t collect salary information and it is the wrong metric to focus on anyway. We advise you to take whatever job fits your lifestyle at first. Then put in some dues like you are expected to. Make a good impression and some good business connections, then start looking for more money and a better job. You need your foot in the door first!</div></div></div><div class="col-md-6 marginbottom"><h4 class="topmargin">Onboarding <small>(3)</small></h4><div class="accordion accordion-border clearfix" data-state="closed"><div class="acctitle">How often do you enroll new classes, how soon can I start?</div><div class="acc_content clearfix" style="display: none">We onboard every Monday when we have seats available and students to fill those virtual seats. We will never overbook our Instructors (who the fuck wants to work too hard anyway?) and therefore you will get the attention you need. Onboard Monday, start Tuesday. If you need to start the following Friday because you are in Venice... hell yeah! Not a problem.</div><div class="acctitle">Can I pay now and enroll to save my seat and start at a later date?</div><div class="acc_content clearfix" style="display: none">Yeah, we have the ability to do that as well. Sometimes you are ready to commit, but you don&#39;t yet have the time to start. We get that, and we have you covered!</div><div class="acctitle">How many Units do students usually start with?</div><div class="acc_content clearfix" style="display: none">1 Unit is 13 hours, most of our students start with 2 Units for 26 hours a week. After you get comfortable with the program and your learning starts to spike, we suggest you move to 3 Units a week for optimal progression. But as always, we are flexible!</div></div></div><div class="col-md-6 marginbottom"><h4 class="topmargin">Application Process <small>(3)</small></h4><div class="accordion accordion-border clearfix" data-state="closed"><div class="acctitle">Do you take beginners at Devschool or do I need to prep?</div><div class="acc_content clearfix" style="display: none">We have no problem being your first serious introduction to programming, so we aren&#39;t going to ask you to go jump through some more hoops while you wait to join.</div><div class="acctitle">Do you offer any scholarships or grants?</div><div class="acc_content clearfix" style="display: none">Yep. We have a couple of grants available. You can get $500 off for &quot;Underrepresented in tech&quot;, or 30% off for being from a developing country (Mexico, Brazil, Philippines)!</div><div class="acctitle">Do you accept everyone?</div><div class="acc_content clearfix" style="display: none">We accept non-assholes, who can read, who will work hard, and who want something in life.</div></div></div><div class="col-md-6 marginbottom"><h4 class="topmargin">Our Pricing <small>(3)</small></h4><div class="accordion accordion-border clearfix" data-state="closed"><div class="acctitle">Do you have a way to split the enrollment cost up?</div><div class="acc_content clearfix" style="display: none">Absolutely! We have a layaway plan, which is 50% down and 50% to start. The first half puts you on our special list of incoming students and you get first pick on the next available seats as soon as you pay the second half of your enrollment. But even before then, you get access to our #slack channel so you can socialize with your fellow Devschoolers and to participate in live group sessions led by programming experts!</div><div class="acctitle">Do you offer financing or payments?</div><div class="acc_content clearfix" style="display: none">We no longer offer this service. We are in the business of getting students to graduate and do something awesome with their lives. Unfortunately when we had a financing option, we had too many dropouts. Once we removed the payment plan option, we stopped losing students.</div><div class="acctitle">Do you offer any grants or scholarships?</div><div class="acc_content clearfix" style="display: none">Yep. We offer the following grants for $500 each: &quot;Minority in tech&quot;, &quot;Military service&quot;. Can you qualify for more than one? Say you were a female or hispanic veteran? Yep, that would be $1000 off your tuition at Devschool. We don&#39;t like war and killing, but we love those who give their all in the service of their fellow humans. We are also highly interested in diversifying this industry.</div></div></div><div class="col-md-6 marginbottom"><h4 class="topmargin">Our Curriculum <small>(9)</small></h4><div class="accordion accordion-border clearfix" data-state="closed"><div class="acctitle">How does the electives system work?</div><div class="acc_content clearfix" style="display: none">We don&#39;t just teach coding, we teach job skills, design skills, management skills, business skills, marketing skills, seo skills, you know. We help you get some skills. Lots of em. You can elect for any session along the way to discuss a large array of topics that will be listed in it&#39;s own section.</div><div class="acctitle">Should I learn JavaScript or Ruby or a mix?</div><div class="acc_content clearfix" style="display: none">Ruby is awesome. It can teach you a lot of really cool things about programming. Ruby on Rails makes building websites backed by a relational database fast and easy. However, JavaScript is the future and we will see a slow dying out of Ruby over the next 10 years. Do you want to build apps as an entrepreneur? Then you should do Ruby on Rails and build your application guided by our expert instructors. Do you want to get a job as a programmer building web applications of the future? Well, JavaScript and Node is a much better choice with some Ruby sprinkled in as an elective.</div><div class="acctitle">Does this program include pair programming?</div><div class="acc_content clearfix" style="display: none">Hell yes! Pair programming is actually quite a bit like the life-blood of our program. You start off by pairing directly with your Instructors, and when you don&#39;t know anything yet, they are typing, or telling you what to type. That graduates to you sharing the duties, and eventually when you are towards the end of the program, you pair with other advanced students.</div><div class="acctitle">What are Units and how do they translate to hours?</div><div class="acc_content clearfix" style="display: none">A unit is 13 hours of work, and we start everyone with 2 units a week (26 hours) and they can ramp up to 3 units a week (39 hours) or go down to a single unit (13 hours) or even put themselves on hold for awhile if like kicks you in the ass. Which is does from time to time! Don&#39;t worry, Devschool is ninja yogamaster flexible!</div><div class="acctitle">How often do I meet with my instructor?</div><div class="acc_content clearfix" style="display: none">After you have your onboarding session, you get your initial 2 Units a week scheduled with your Instructors. Those appointments happen each week unless you need to miss or change one. It is fine to cancel last moment with us. We might be code therapists, but we aren&#39;t psychologists! You can just make up that appointment another time.</div><div class="acctitle">How long does it take to complete the program?</div><div class="acc_content clearfix" style="display: none">That depends entirely on you and your own situation. If you do 3 Units a week you could finish in as little as 16 weeks. If you can only handle a single Unit a week, you could be with us for a year. That is ok with us if it is ok with you. We heard you were pretty fun!</div><div class="acctitle">Do I learn from live mentorship or watching videos?</div><div class="acc_content clearfix" style="display: none">What if I told you, you get to have your cake and eat it too? Well get those forks ready, because you learn from live experts, one on one, coding software together in real time. But you also have full access to egghead.io and frontendmasters.com when you enroll with us. To top it off, those live one on ones with real experts? Those are recorded locally on your machine, automagically, every-time, so you can build your own library of 50+ kick ass screencasts to mark your education milestones!</div><div class="acctitle">Do you teach any Angular, React, Meteor, or Ruby Rails?</div><div class="acc_content clearfix" style="display: none">Yes, although we focus on the language and style of programming, data structures, and principles like SOLID more than specific frameworks. If you are taking JavaScript you will learn gulp, express, and node from us, and then suppliment your framework diet with expert instruction from the included licenses to Egghead.io or FrontEndMasters.com. If you are studying Ruby or a mix of the two you will learn Ruby on Rails.</div><div class="acctitle">Do I get a detailed curriculum?</div><div class="acc_content clearfix" style="display: none">There is no detailed curriculum on anything. Our program is based on experience and real work, not school.</div></div></div></div></div></section><section id="apply" class="section nomargin noborder bgcolor dark" style="margin-bottom: 0px"><div class="content-wrap"><div class="container clearfix bottommargin"><div class="heading-block center nomargin"><h3>Make 2016 the year you change your life!</h3></div></div><div class="container clear-bottommargin clearfix"><div class="row form"><div class="form-card"><h3>Start today at no cost!
