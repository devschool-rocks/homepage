I would highly recommend Jim and Devschool for any prospective students out there! I have been a student for about 4 months and have learned a ton. Initially I wanted to find a program to help me transition from IT support to a developer and find a programmer job. I now have that developer job and I owe a big thanks to Devschool for helping me develop the required skills to get it.

The reason I chose the Devschool is that it is not a "bootcamp" as we usually understand the word - it is a mentorship mixed with a friendship and strong community. Exactly what I needed: build a real world projects of my choice using tools I want or which are really in trend today.

I took my first devbootcamp in my city, but in the middle of my bussy life (work - bootcamp) I missed a lot of key topics that leave behind a lot of questions without answers. Devschool filled all those gaps and much more!

I was one of Jim's first official Devschool students back in April of 2015 after having been his customer for several months previously while I attended Dev Bootcamp in NYC. I found that even after 10 hours a day at school learning and hacking, I was missing some major understanding in the Rails stack and in some of the smaller details of web development.

After months of searching I started reading about Devschool and how highly the school was recommended was from previous students who graduated the program.  I spoke with Jim numerous times and he was always patient when it came to answering my questions and concerns, and I was impressed with how Devschool was not the typical “Big Box” outfit.

I did a lot of research before deciding on Devschool. From a pragmatic standpoint, I'm receiving hundreds of hours of personalized education, a personalized education plan, and constant support for a very fair price. On a more personal level, I spoke to Jim for like 20 minutes and I quickly realized that I wanted to enroll.
